/** Description:
  *   Write a program to read two 3x3 matrices, compute the sum, the product of the two matrices.
  *   Then, compute the transpose, cofactor matrix and the determinant of the resultant matrix. Then
  *   find the inverse of the first matrix then multiply it by the first column of the second matrix
  *   to get the third matrix. Also tested using the matrices given in class.
  *   
  *   In this program write a different method to perfrom the operations and use proper notation to
  *   pass the arguments and to access the elements.
  *   
  *   Use files for input and output. Make sure to use class and objects. Use constructor and overload
  *   constructor to initialize the object.
  *
  * Assumptions:
  *   - The matrices will be multiplied in the order they are read
  *   - Only the product matrix will have its transpose, cofactor, and determinant taken.
  *   - The "first matrix" will be the first matrix read, and the "second matrix" will be the second
  *   	matrix read.
  *   - The input and output files will have the same format
  *   - The files will not be formatted, they will only be formatted when they are printed
